When you access our website, certain data is automatically processed and stored in server log files, e.g.:

**4. Hosting and cloud services (e.g. AWS)**

Our website is hosted by [hosting provider, e.g. Amazon Web Services EMEA SARL]. This may involve processing of personal data on servers located in the EU and, where configured, in third countries.

Processing is based on our legitimate interests in a secure and efficient provision of our online services (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR).

[If third-country transfers (e.g. US) occur:]
